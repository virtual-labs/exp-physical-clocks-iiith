### Procedure

### TODOs

- Initialize the simulation environment and graphical elements.
- Implement functions to handle user interactions (e.g., click events on nodes, button clicks).
- Animate graphical elements to visualize the NTP communication process and synchronization metrics.
- Simulate NTP communication (packet exchange, clock adjustment) between nodes and the central clock.
- Update synchronization metrics (offset, delay, jitter) based on simulation data.
- Implement real-time clock updates and synchronization events triggered by user interactions.




### Simulation Environment Setup

Design a virtual network environment consisting of multiple nodes (computers) connected through a simulated network. Represent each node with a graphical icon or symbol to visually differentiate them. Display a central clock that represents the "official" time source (NTP server).


#### Interactive Nodes

Allow users to interact with each node by clicking on them. Upon clicking a node, display information about the node such as its ID, current time, and synchronization status.


#### Animated NTP Communication

Visualize the exchange of NTP packets between the nodes and the central clock. Use animations to illustrate the process of time synchronization, including packet transmission, acknowledgment, and adjustment of local clocks.


#### Real-Time Clock Updates

Implement real-time updates of the displayed clocks to reflect the current time of each node and the central clock. Use animations to smoothly transition between time updates to enhance the visual experience.


#### Synchronization Metrics

Calculate and display synchronization metrics such as offset, delay, and jitter for each node compared to the central clock. Visualize these metrics using graphical elements (e.g., bar charts, line graphs) to demonstrate the synchronization performance of each node.


#### User Interaction

Allow users to initiate synchronization events manually or automatically trigger synchronization at predefined intervals. Provide options to adjust simulation parameters such as network delay and packet loss to observe their impact on synchronization accuracy.


#### Data Logging and Analysis

Log synchronization events and metrics data for further analysis. Allow users to export data for offline analysis or visualization using external tools.


#### Educational Content

Include informative tooltips or pop-ups to explain key concepts related to NTP and distributed systems. Provide references to relevant literature or resources for deeper understanding.




### Experiment Flow

#### Introduction

Provide a brief overview of NTP and its importance in distributed systems.

#### Interactive Exploration

Encourage users to interact with the nodes and observe the effects of synchronization.


#### Parameter Adjustment

Allow users to modify simulation parameters and observe how they affect synchronization performance.


#### Data Analysis

Analyze synchronization metrics and discuss the implications of the results.


#### Conclusion

Summarize the key findings of the experiment and emphasize the importance of time synchronization in distributed systems.


# ----------------


1. Simulation Environment:

The simulation environment serves as the central area where nodes and the NTP server are displayed. It should be visually distinct and clearly defined to focus users' attention on the simulation.

2. Nodes:

Nodes represent individual computers or devices in the distributed system. They should be positioned around the simulation environment to simulate a network topology.
Each node should be visually identifiable with a unique icon or symbol. Clicking on a node should display relevant information about the node, such as its ID, current time, and synchronization status.

3. NTP Server:

The NTP server serves as the central time source for synchronization. It should be prominently displayed within the simulation environment, possibly in the center or a designated area.
The NTP server should have a distinct visual representation to differentiate it from nodes. Clicking on the NTP server may display additional information or options related to time synchronization.

4. Controls:

Control buttons should be provided for users to interact with the simulation, such as starting or pausing the simulation, adjusting parameters, or resetting the simulation.
The control buttons should be placed in a prominent location near the simulation environment for easy access.

5. Information Display:

Relevant information about the simulation, nodes, and synchronization metrics should be displayed to users in a clear and organized manner.
Information may include node IDs, current time, synchronization status, synchronization metrics (offset, delay, jitter), simulation parameters, and any other relevant data.

6. Interactive Elements:

Users should be able to interact with various elements within the simulation environment, such as clicking on nodes to view information, adjusting simulation parameters, or initiating synchronization events.

7. Visual Feedback:

Visual feedback should be provided to users to indicate the status of the simulation, node interactions, and synchronization events.
Animation, color changes, or other visual cues can be used to convey information and enhance the user experience.

8. Educational Content:

In addition to the simulation elements, educational content such as tooltips, pop-ups, or informational panels can be included to provide explanations, definitions, and insights into the concepts being demonstrated in the experiment.
